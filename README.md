# traffic_sign_classification
The project "Traffic Sign Classification" aims to develop an automated system for recognizing and classifying traffic signs. 
This system utilizes Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and the Keras deep learning library to train a model on a dataset of labeled traffic sign images. The trained model is then used to predict the class of traffic signs in new images.
The project implements various image preprocessing techniques such as resizing and normalization to prepare the images for CNN processing. The CNN model architecture consists of multiple convolutional and pooling layers, followed by fully connected layers and a softmax output layer.
